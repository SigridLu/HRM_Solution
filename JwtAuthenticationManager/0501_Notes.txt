For Authentication_API, we will be using Identity.EntityFrameworkCore to deal with accounts and authentications.
Because [Microsoft.ASP.NET CORE Identity.EntityFrameworkCore] provides the following services:
1. It will handle the operations to create user account, validate user account
2. 2 Factor validations

IdentityUser<TKey> class:
has properties we can use for creating account.
We can create customized class for other properties and inherit IdentityUser class.

IdentityDbContext is a DbContext that available for IdentityUser package.
Because the entities(tables) of IdentityUser are predefined in package,
instead of creating our own entity and migrate to database,
we can directly call IdentityDbContext and migrate to database.
